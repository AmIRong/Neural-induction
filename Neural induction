Summary

Almost as early as multicellular(多细胞) animals evolved, neurons have been part of their
their tissues, Metazoan nervous systems range in complexity(复杂) from the simple nerve（神经）
net of the jellyfish(水母) to the billions of specifically interconnected(相互连接) neuron assemblies(集群) of 
the human brain.Nevertheless,the neurons and nervous systems of all multicellular animals share many common
features.Voltage-gated(电压门控) ion(电子) channels are responsible for action potentials(潜在) in the neurons of
Jellyfish as they are in people. Synaptic(突触) transmission between neurons in nerve nets is basically the 
same as that in the cerebral (大脑的，理智的) cortex(皮层) in humans(Figure 1.1). This book describes the
mechanisms responsible for the generation of these nervous systems,highlighting examples from a variety of
organisms.(有机组织) Despite the great diversity (多样性) in the nervous systems of various organisms,underlying
principles of neural development have been maintained throughout evolution.
It is appropriate to begin a book concerned(牵连的) with the development of the nervous system with an evolution
have long shared an interrelated(相互关联) intellectual history. One of the major currents of late-nineteenth-century
biology was that a desciption of the stages of development would provide the key to the path of evolution of life.The
phrase "ontogeny(个体早期发生) recapitulates phylogeny“ was important at the start of experimental (实验) embryology(胚胎学）
（Gould，1970）。Although the careful study of embryos showed that they did not resemble the adult forms of their ancestors
(祖先），it is clear that new forms are built upon the structures of biological predecessors.One aim of this book is to show
how an understanding of the development of the nervous system will give us insight into its evolution.It is also wise to remember
,as Dobzhansky pointed out,"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."
